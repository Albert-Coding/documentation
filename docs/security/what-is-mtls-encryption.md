Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is a method of encrypting network traffic between services within a Temporal Cluster, or between application processes and a Cluster.

Like TLS, self-signed or properly minted certificates can be used for authenticating users.

Mutual TLS can be enabled in Temporalâ€™s TLS configuration. This configuration can be passed along through WithConfig or WithConfigLoader.

This configuration includes two sections that serve to separate intra-cluster and external traffic. That way, different certificates and settings can be used to encrypt each section of traffic:

- internode
- frontend
