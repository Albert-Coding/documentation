You can find a complete list of executable code samples in the samples' library.

The [Temporal Simple Polyglot](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal-polyglot) repository showcases how Workflow Executions, written in different languages, can send messages to each other. Go, Java, PHP, and TypeScript SDKs are represented in this sample. 
It also shows how to properly propagate errors, including how to do so across Workflows written in different languages.


Additionally, several of the [Tutorials](/learning-paths) are backed by a fully executable template application.
