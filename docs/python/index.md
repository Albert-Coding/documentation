pip install temporalio
```

**Are there executable code samples?**

You can find a complete list of executable code samples in the [Samples Library](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python), which includes Temporal Python SDK code samples.

**Where is the Python SDK technical reference?**

The Temporal Python SDK API reference is published on [python.temporal.io](https://python.temporal.io/index.html).
