Temporal emits metrics by default in a format that is supported by Prometheus. Monitoring and observing those metrics is optional. Any software that can pull metrics that supports the same format could be used, but we ensure it works with Prometheus and Grafana versions only.

- Prometheus >= v2.0
- Grafana >= v2.5
