You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [`tctl`](/tctl/)
- [Replay](#replay)
- [Tracing](/application-development/observability#tracing)
- [Logging](/application-development/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/application-development/worker-performance). See [Observability ▶️ Metrics](/application-development/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

You can debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/how-to-monitor-temporal-cloud-metrics) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/server/production-deployment#scaling-and-metrics).
